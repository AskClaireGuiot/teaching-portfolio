                        <p class="text-body">
                            I began teaching in 2018 and became full-time faculty in 2019. Over the next five years, I completed the Provincial Instructor Diploma Program (PIDP), intentionally pacing the coursework to apply each concept thoughtfully in the classroom.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-body">
                            The PIDP profoundly shaped my teaching. Starting with no inherited materials and no textbook gave me the opportunity to design every course from the ground up—integrating best practices from the start. I incorporated tools like DACUM analysis, BOPPPS lesson planning, learning outcomes, rubrics, and feedback strategies directly into my curriculum.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="teaching-subsection">
                        <h4 class="text-heading-4">Real-world learning, one layer at a time</h4>
                        <p class="text-body">
                            Each course I design is clear, purposeful, and rooted in real-world relevance and evidence-based learning theory. My courses prioritize practice over high-stakes assessments. Students develop meaningful projects that reflect industry workflows and standards—projects they can carry into portfolios and professional contexts. Assessment is mostly formative and iterative, students receive frequent, specific feedback from peers and from myself.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="text-heading-4">Scaffolded for skill-building</h4>
                        <p class="text-body">
                            Courses build progressively, with each week deepening prior learning. This scaffolding supports skill development within Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development (1978), helping students gradually gain confidence and independence. Projects are cumulative to support deeper learning and aligns with research showing that authentic, progressively structured tasks with instructor coaching at critical times, enhances real-world transfer (Herrington & Oliver, 2000).

                        <p class="text-body">
                            Assessment in my courses is designed to promote continuous learning, not just measure it, and combines a mix of:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="text-body">
                            <li><strong>Low-stakes formative assessments:</strong> weekly quizzes and in-class exercises</li>
                            <li><strong>Medium-stakes summative tasks:</strong> unit exams and authentic projects</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="text-body">
                            This approach aligns with Black and Wiliam's (1998) findings that regular, varied assessment with feedback improves learning outcomes. By diversifying formats and pacing evaluation over time, I support accessibility, offering multiple ways for students to demonstrate understanding and build confidence.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-body">
                            Grades are required, but they're not the driver. Inspired by ungrading models, I strive to make evaluation transparent, flexible, and rooted in growth and self-reflection. Students engage in peer critique, use rubrics for self-assessment, and reflect on their learning journey throughout the term.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-body">
                            As our programs are geared toward employment, I design curriculum based on industry input from our Advisory Committee, labour data, and my own ongoing work as a contractor. To keep pace with rapidly evolving tools, I create all lesson materials—custom videos, curated readings, and clear assignment instructions—rather than relying on textbooks. Projects are authentic, and guest speakers offer real-world insight, aligning with research that shows professionally grounded, context-rich tasks enhance engagement and promote the transfer of learning to practical settings (Herrington & Oliver, 2000).

                        <p class="text-body">
                            A consistent weekly rhythm supports self-regulation and reduces cognitive load, helping students build confidence and competence. Research in Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and cognitive psychology highlights how predictable structures support diverse learning styles, promotes time management, and reinforces key concepts (CAST, 2018; Sweller, 1988).

My learning materials are designed to be visually clear, cognitively accessible, and aligned with how students actually engage with content online.

                        <p class="text-body">
                            My approach to educational technology is pedagogy-first, not tool-first. The digital learning environments I design are purpose-built to:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="text-body">
                            <li>Reduce cognitive load by clearly documenting all course logistics.</li>
                            <li>Support autonomy through the use of rubrics, pacing guides, and checklists.</li>
                            <li>Provide timely, targeted feedback via tools like quizzes, Kaltura video, and intelligent agents.</li>
                            <li>Surface student engagement trends using LMS analytics.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="text-body">
                            Although I experiment with interactive content tools like H5P, I prioritize agile, update-friendly content that can evolve with industry trends and technologies.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="text-heading-4">Authentic tools, balanced integration</h4>
                        <p class="text-body">I incorporate professional platforms to introduce students to authentic, real-world workflows.</p>
                        <ul class="text-body">
                            <li><strong>VS Code, GitHub Classroom and Codepen</strong> – for coding, version control and collaborative code reviews.</li>
                            <li><strong>Adobe and Figma products</strong> – for design, critiques and real-time collaboration.</li>
                            <li><strong>Google Suite</strong> - for file sharing and real-time collaboration.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="text-body">
                            At the same time, I am mindful of interface overload. There is a careful balance to strike between expanding students' digital versatility and ensuring they are not overwhelmed by too many tools or logins.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-body">
                            While I prefer tools hosted in Canada for privacy and security reasons, I carefully weigh these considerations against the value of teaching industry-standard workflows.

                        <h4 class="text-heading-4">A creative gap in tech</h4>
                        <p class="text-body">
                            One ongoing challenge in my practice is the lack of a platform that truly supports asynchronous design critique with the pedagogical depth and administrative functionality required in post-secondary education. While creative collaboration tools like Figma enable iterative feedback, they often lack grading tools and structured evaluation frameworks. I continue to prototype solutions that bridge this gap—balancing dialogic engagement with the logistical needs of educational institutions.

                        <p class="text-body">
                            Beyond collaborative assignments, I use technology to build authentic, connected learning communities, and foster student connection and inclusion across modes of delivery:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="text-body">
                            <li><strong>Slack & Mattermost channels</strong> to create informal spaces for peer learning and real-time support (the digital campus hallway).</li>
                            <li><strong>Persistent Slack channels</strong> to connect alumni and current students, supporting mentorship and continuity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Social media</strong> to showcase celebrate student work and deepen engagement.</li>
                            <li><strong>Optional online drop-in sessions</strong> for equitable access to feedback and coaching.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="text-body">
                            These practices are aligned with the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework, which emphasizes the interplay between social, cognitive, and teaching presence as central to inclusive, high-quality online learning (Garrison, Anderson, & Archer, 2000).

                        <p class="text-body">
                            My courses are built around the learner experience. North Island College attracts a diverse student population, including many international students and learners with varied digital fluency, goals, and life responsibilities. In response, I use strategies inspired by Universal Design for Learning (UDL) (CAST, 2018):
                        </p>

                            <li><strong>Multiple means of engagement:</strong> choice in project topics, formats, and tools.</li>
                            <li><strong>Checkpoints for understanding:</strong> low-stakes quizzes, self-reflections, discussion forums, and peer reviews.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pacing flexibility:</strong> clear timelines combined with white space for catch-up and self-regulation.</li>

                            Students are encouraged to shape their learning journeys. I create room for autonomy while providing structure and ongoing support.

                        <p class="text-body">
                            I actively work to create inclusive and safe learning environments, both in-person and online. My teaching materials include diverse perspectives, and students are given voice and choice wherever possible.

                        <p class="text-body">
                            Indigenization is an ongoing responsibility in Canadian post-secondary education and I recognize that I have a lot of progress to make in this area. I feel that by prioritizing respect, self-expression and agency in my classes, I have implemented pedagogical approaches that foster a deeper understanding and appreciation of different cultures and ways of knowing.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-body">
                            In courses like Graphic Design Foundations, I embed discussions of visual culture, representation, and decolonizing the design process. In more technical courses like web development or programming I find it a lot harder. I'm exploring how to critically examine the colonial roots of computing and imagine what Indigenized or decolonized tech education might look like. For example, programming languages such as HTML, CSS and PHP reflect Western systems of logic and classification. Indigenization invites us to question these systems, consider what's been excluded, and explore new ways of thinking about knowledge and systems design - this extends to UI design and Ed Tech solutions generally, not just the content and tools of my specific coding courses.
